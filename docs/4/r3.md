# Using Task manager in CI systems

We use our task manager file in all CI systems except in Buddy (which we use to use the Docker image) and except in Drone.io (for doing something different)


The cleanest and simplest example is that of Azure Pipelines

```yaml
# Starter pipeline
# Start with a minimal pipeline that you can customize to build and deploy your code.
# Add steps that build, run tests, deploy, and more:
# https://aka.ms/yaml

trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-18.04'

container: 'rust:latest'

steps:
- script: cargo install --force cargo-make
  displayName: 'Install task runner -> cargo make'
  # https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make
- script: cargo make --makefile make.toml test
  displayName: 'Run test with cargo'
```
