# R1. Continuos Integration. Continuos Deployment.

## Why?

1. It allows me to make sure that my code meets a series of requirements that I can define in a flexible and dynamic way according to my needs. My initial need is that the project is always executable and passes the tests
2. It allows me to be able to define deployment tasks, which allows me to launch and execute code at the infrastructure level in a reproducible way and therefore allows me to automate the deployment of my application.
3. It allows me to have more transparency during the development. In case someone PRs me to the repository by adding some new functionality or fixing a bug, you can track the changes and why the test is successful or not.


I will be using different CI/CD systems, so I can explore different platforms and assess which ones I like best and which ones are better suited to my project (and future projects).

## Travis as CI

Travis is a hosted CI system configured adding a `.travis.yml` in our repo.

We can find the configuration of a Travis repository in [exercise 5 of lesson 2](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/CC-Ejercicios/blob/master/02.md#ejercicio-5)



```yaml
sudo: false

language: rust

# It allows to use cache files like
# ~/.cargo/registry/index
# ~/.cargo/registry/cache
# ./target
# ~/.cargo/git
cache: cargo

branches:
    only:
        # Which branches I want to respond
        # If you have a updated repo, should be: main
        - master

rust:
    # Each rust version I want to test
    - 1.47.0

install:
    # We install our task-runner dependencies
    # cargo-make
    - cargo install --force cargo-make

script:
    # Running the task runner
    cargo make --makefile make.toml test
```

You can check the story of this configuration in [issue #63](https://github.com/pepitoenpeligro/cloudbanking/issues/63)

We can check the status of CI pipeline with the Travis Badge:  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pepitoenpeligro/cloudbanking.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pepitoenpeligro/cloudbanking)


:warning: If you have an account in travis.org, and your repo activated there, you need to migrate the repo to Travis.com before running any pipeline.
